# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Yvan Gauthier 
A software engineer with a passion native iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, and WatchOS software  development. With some experience working with Linux I also enjoy learning and working on sytem and imbeded software, I enjoy tackling complex problems, building tools, and delving into low-level development. I have a strong interest in mastering deep technical subjects like C and C++ programming, but also Swift, Objective-C, beeing the prefered languages for the Appple ecosystem. 

When I'm not coding, I'm certainly working on my other interest with is my math skills, sport exercice, and movies.
