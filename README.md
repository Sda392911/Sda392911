# 👋 Hi, I’m Yvan Gauthier 
I'm a software engineer interested in building software for the Apple ecosystem. I enjoy working with low-level languages such as C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift to produce useful software that people would enjoy using, whether to help or entertain them in their daily lives. I have a decade of experience working with UNIX systems like GNU/Linux, which I successfully used as my daily driver.

For the past few years, I've been running macOS, which is now my daily driver, and I love it. I've decided to focus my efforts on this platform. I'm always eager to learn and talk about tech-related subjects, discuss ideas, or hear feedback on what's working and what isn't. As long as it's constructive criticism, I'm perfectly fine with it. 😉
