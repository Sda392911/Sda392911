# 👋 Hi, I’m Yvan Gauthier 
A software engineer with a passion for systems programming and embedded systems development and now iOS and MacOS. With over a decade of experience working with Linux, I enjoy tackling complex problems, building tools, and delving into low-level development. I have a strong interest in mastering deep technical subjects like C and C++ programming, but also Swift, Objective-C, beeing the prefered languages for the Appple ecosystem. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new challenges in the Apple development ecosystem or enhancing my skill set with new programming languages and techniques.
