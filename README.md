# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Yvan Gauthier 

    I'm a software engineer interested in building software for the Apple ecosystem. I enjoy working with low-level languages such as C,
    C++, Objective-C, and Swift to produce
    useful software that people would enjoy using, whether to help or entertain them in their daily lives. I have a decade of experience
    working with UNIX systems like GNU/Linux,
    which I successfully used as my daily driver.
    
    For the past few years, I've been running macOS, which is now my daily driver, and I love it. I've decided to focus my efforts on this
    platform. I'm always eager to learn and
    talk about tech-related subjects, discuss ideas, or hear feedback on what's working and what isn't. As long as it's constructive
    criticism, I'm perfectly fine with it. üòâ

## üëÄ I'm interested in ... 

    Building quality software, I love understanding the ins and outs of the software I write. I believe that, in most cases, understanding
    things at the deepest possible level allows us to make better decisions when solving specific problems. That‚Äôs why I love old-school
    languages like C and C++ so much‚Äîthey allow developers to dive deep into what we do.
    
    Of course, I‚Äôm not a C expert yet, and I‚Äôm still learning, but I love these languages for that reason alone. Objective-C is anothe
    language I‚Äôm going to investigate and experiment with, as it‚Äôs the main language used by Apple for their drivers.
